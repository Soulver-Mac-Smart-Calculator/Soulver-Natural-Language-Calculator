## What is Soulver?

Soulver is more than just a calculator; it's a dynamic text-based math environment that interprets your words and numbers together. Designed for clarity and efficiency, it lets you type out problems as you think of them, providing immediate results alongside your notes. This approach makes it an indispensable tool for anyone who regularly deals with calculations, from quick arithmetic to detailed financial planning.

Its core strength lies in understanding context. You can ask it "What is 20% of $150?" or "150 USD in EUR" and get an answer instantly, with support for live exchange rates. It manages variables and can reference previous lines, making it powerful for building up complex calculations step-by-step. Soulver eliminates the need to switch between a calculator app and a notepad, combining both into a single, streamlined workflow.

Optimized for performance and integration with macOS features like Spotlight and Shortcuts, Soulver Natural Language Calculator offers a fluid experience. It supports document autosave, custom themes, and extensive export options. For engineers, scientists, writers, and business users, Soulver provides a unique way to calculate, convert, and compute without leaving a natural, text-editing environment.
